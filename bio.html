		  <p>My name is Amelia, and I am from Chicago! I go to Columbia College, located downtown. I 
			like to watch anime, make memes, and write stories and read books! my major is Animation
			and people would describe me as creative. I have never been to a concert before, but I love 
			music. My favorite genre is rap, but I am open to all kinds of music. My favorite female rapper 
			is Nicki Minaj, and my favorite song is Hypnotic Data, even though it's hard to pick a favorite
			song, becuase I have a playlist full of my favorite songs already! I am working on publishing my
			first book this year, so that is exciting for me! It is about my brother, and a coming of age story.
			I don't like extremely hot weather or extremely cold weather, but if I had to pick, my favorite
			season would be summer because it means no school! </p>
