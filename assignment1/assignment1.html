		<h1>The Division of the Internet</h1>

		<p> The article talks about the history of the internet and how it
			changed over the years, but I wanted to focus on how the author
			dislikes how it changed for the future. I believe it has to do 
			with PR and marketing because daily interactions play a role in
			how we view any product or service. For example, Facebook, 
			“Instead, it is roundly vilified for the role it played in the 
			election of far-right idiots and parties to positions of power, 
			its misuse of users' data through companies like Cambridge 
			Analytica, its generally hapless promotion of fake news and hate
			speech, its whimsical annihilation of journalism—all for a quick
			thirty-nine billion or so in ad revenue. 'The Social Network' is
			known now as a 'Racist Boomerland'” (Revenge of the Old 
			Internet?). I believe the internet isn't perfect and there were 
			always similar issues with the internet in the past, but due to 
			the progression, we are able to learn about these issues quicker 
			since we have greater and quicker access to information. There 
			are plenty of issues with the internet, but when it first came 
			out, not everyone had a personal blog, or social media to share 
			information, or had the ability to screenshot texts and pictures.

			It is a common stereotype that older people think that the internet 
			is "bad" or "dangerous". While there are some older people who are 
			wary of the internet and its potential to harm them, it's important 
			to recognize that this attitude is not necessarily representative of 
			all older people. In fact, there are many older people who are tech-
			savvy, use the internet regularly, and are comfortable with all of 
			the benefits it provides. The idea that older people think the internet 
			is bad may stem from a lack of understanding or experience with 
			technology, which can make it difficult for them to appreciate the 
			value that it can bring. Additionally, there may be concerns about privacy
			and security that older people have about the internet, which is 
			understandable given the potential for identity theft and other online
			scams. However, it's important to recognize that the internet has the
			potential to be a powerful tool for older people, providing them with
			access to information, communication, and other benefits that may not
			be available to them through other means. Overall, while older people
			may have some reservations about the internet, it's essential to recognize
			that it has the potential to be an invaluable resource for them and their 
			families.

			While the internet provides a platform for all types of users, different 
			social media platforms and communities tend to attract different demographics.
			This can be due to many different factors, such as the platform's user-friendly
			interface, the types of content that are promoted, the culture of the community,
			and more. For example, Facebook has traditionally been seen as a platform that
			is popular with older audiences, including Boomers and older Millennials, 
			while platforms like TikTok and Instagram are more popular with younger 
			generations like Gen Z. This is not necessarily because the platforms are better
			or worse, but rather because they cater to different interests and needs. This 
			diversity can be a great thing, as it allows users to find communities that align
			with their interests and values. However, it's also important to recognize that 
			some online communities can attract or promote negative or harmful content. This 
			can be true of any platform or community, regardless of its target audience.
		</p>
		<p>
			Overall, it's important to approach the internet with a critical eye and understand
			the potential risks and benefits of different platforms and communities. As with 
			anything, it's important to use the internet responsibly and be aware of the potential
			consequences of our actions.
